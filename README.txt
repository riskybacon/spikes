Spikes are meant to be small, proof-of-concept programs.
The programs are not meant to be full featured libraries
or demonstrations. Their only use is for understanding
a concept or for getting started on a new program that
may need this concept.

The reason this repository was created was for my 
personal use. I frequently find that I need a particular
concept that I have coded up previously, but either 
cannot find it or it is so tightly coupled to the rest
of my code that it is more difficult to pull out that
code than it is to start over.
