OpenGL 3.2 and 4.1 demonstrations. These are written primarily
under OS X Lion, which supports OpenGL 3.2, but then are tested
on Linux and Windows, for which OpenGL 4.1 support is available.

The hope is that these programs will work under both versions.

I named the subdirectory 4.1 because I felt that naming it 3.2
was pessimistic.
